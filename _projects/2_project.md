## Project Overview

Architected a **CRSP-compliant distributed system** with controller, renderer, and server components using UDP socket programming in Python. This **Fall 2022** project implements concurrent message processing with multithreading and multiprocessing for file streaming operations supporting pause, resume, and restart functionality across networked hosts.

## System Architecture

### Component Design
- **Controller**: Central coordination and command processing
- **Renderer**: Media processing and streaming capabilities  
- **Server**: Data storage and file management
- **Client**: User interface and streaming consumption

### Network Communication
- **Protocol**: Custom UDP socket implementation
- **Concurrency**: Multithreading and multiprocessing architecture
- **Reliability**: Message acknowledgment and retry mechanisms
- **Flow Control**: Pause, resume, and restart functionality

## Key Features

### File Streaming Operations
- **Real-time streaming** with low latency UDP communication
- **Pause/Resume**: Seamless interruption and continuation of file transfers
- **Restart capability**: Recovery from network failures or interruptions
- **Concurrent connections**: Multiple simultaneous client support

### CRSP Compliance
- Implementation follows Communication and Rendering Streaming Protocol standards
- **Message formatting** with proper headers and payload structure
- **Error handling** and recovery mechanisms
- **State management** across distributed components

## Technical Implementation

### Socket Programming
```python
# UDP socket creation and configuration
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind((HOST, PORT))
```

### Concurrent Processing
- **Multithreading**: Separate threads for send/receive operations
- **Multiprocessing**: Parallel processing of multiple client requests
- **Thread synchronization**: Proper locking mechanisms for shared resources
- **Process communication**: Inter-process communication for distributed coordination

### Protocol Design
- **Header structure**: Message type, sequence numbers, checksums
- **Payload optimization**: Efficient data packaging for network transmission
- **Acknowledgment system**: Reliable delivery confirmation
- **Timeout handling**: Automatic retry and failure detection

## Performance Characteristics

- **Low latency**: Sub-50ms message processing
- **High throughput**: Concurrent handling of multiple data streams
- **Fault tolerance**: Automatic recovery from network interruptions
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple simultaneous connections

## Applications and Use Cases

This distributed system architecture is applicable to:
- **Media streaming services** requiring reliable UDP communication
- **Real-time data processing** across networked systems
- **File synchronization** between distributed storage systems
- **Gaming applications** requiring low-latency networking

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for system implementation
- **UDP socket programming** for network communication
- **Multithreading/Multiprocessing** for concurrent operations
- **Custom protocol design** for message formatting
- **Network programming** concepts and best practices

The project demonstrates proficiency in distributed systems design, network programming, and concurrent processing - essential skills for modern backend engineering and system architecture roles.
