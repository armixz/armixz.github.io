Hi, I'm `Armin Ziaei`, a dedicated `Computer Scientist` with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas. My passion for technology drives me to continuously explore and innovate in the realms of software engineering and system operations. At [HHAeXchange](https://www.hhaexchange.com/), where I work as a DevOps/SysOps Engineer, I utilize a range of technologies to enhance system efficiency and performance.

Throughout my career, I've honed my skills in multiple programming languages such as `C/C++`, `Python`, and `Java`. I thrive on solving complex problems and collaborating effectively with diverse teams. My `GitHub` profile features various projects, from machine learning applications to system simulations, showcasing my commitment to advancing my technical expertise and contributing to the tech community.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/armixz/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armin-ziaei-9594748b/) to follow my journey and explore my work.
